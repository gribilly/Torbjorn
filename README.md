# Torbjorn - An HTML Tag Viewer
This is my solution for a Slack coding challenge.  You can see a [live demo of it here](https://torbjorn.herokuapp.com/).


**Note: Demo might be slow on first launch.**  This is because it is being hosted on a free Heroku account which will sleep the app if it's [been inactive for 30 minutes](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours).

For more information on how this web-app works, check out the readme.html in this project or at [the url here](https://torbjorn.herokuapp.com/about/).
